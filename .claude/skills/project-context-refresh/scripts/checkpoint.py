"""Branch-local context checkpoint (ri-09).

A checkpoint is a read-only, scope-restricted, per-work-package report of the
project context a feature branch has invalidated. It composes machinery that
already exists — the ri-08 context-impact detector, the ri-05 producer registry,
the ri-04 architecture provenance, and the ri-06 value objects — and adds only
report assembly.

**D1 is the load-bearing decision and it is a prohibition.** This module does not
construct an ``OperationStore``, does not create, record into, or finalize a
refresh operation, and does not emit a refresh manifest. ri-07 D9 makes a
recorded producer result immutable for its revision and reuses it verbatim in
later refreshes; a checkpoint result is scope-restricted and feature-namespaced,
so admitting one into the shared ledger would be unrecoverable *by design*
rather than by accident — nothing in the ri-06 contract can distinguish or
supersede it. ``checkout_policy`` cannot catch that mistake because it reasons
about the worktree path only, while the ledger lives in the clone-global git
common directory (D10), so the invariant is asserted here and pinned by
``test_checkpoint_isolation.py``.

What this module owns:

* :func:`should_checkpoint` — the trigger decision ``implement-feature``
  consumes, keyed on the ri-08 status of the package's own changed-file list
  (D2). ``unmigrated`` (no ``context_impact`` block) is reported as itself and
  never collapsed into "no impact": absence of evidence is not an assertion.
* :func:`run_checkpoint` — dispatch every configured producer through
  ``registry.run_producer`` in ``check`` mode only (D3), collect architecture
  freshness and delta as *separate* findings (D6), attempt the degradable
  semantic index in a ``work_package`` namespace (D4/D5/D9), and write one
  byte-stable report (D7).

The report never fails the run: drift is data, and turning it into a build
failure belongs to the drift-gate capability (D8). The single non-zero outcome
is being unable to produce a valid report at all, which surfaces as
:class:`CheckpointError`.
