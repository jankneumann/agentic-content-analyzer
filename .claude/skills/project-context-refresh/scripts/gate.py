"""Composed deterministic context drift gate (ri-10, design D1/D5/D6/D7).

One command that answers one question: *does this revision carry deterministic
context drift a reviewer must fix before merge?* It composes three arms that
exist already and adds the single thing none of them expresses — an exit code
derived from a classification rather than from a collapsed terminal state:

* **deterministic producers** — via :func:`orchestrator.check`, which runs every
  registered producer in ``check`` mode and writes neither the durable store nor
  the working tree. Dispatch is not re-implemented here;
* **architecture freshness** — via the orchestrator's architecture seam, whose
  default compares *committed* provenance with ``check_freshness`` and fails
  closed on unverifiable evidence (D4). Consumed, not re-implemented;
* **work-package context impact** — ri-08's ``validate_context_impact``, invoked
  over the ``work-packages.yaml`` files present in the diff under test and
  **never** with ``--strict-legacy`` (D7).

Ownership boundary. This module owns *composition, classification wiring, and
rendering*. It owns no producer, no result model, and no schema. ``cli.py gate``
is a thin argument-parsing wrapper and ``make context-drift-gate`` is a thin
``make`` call, so a CI failure reproduces verbatim in a developer checkout —
which is the point of putting the rendering in Python instead of assembling it
from shell over job output (D1).

Exit codes (D5), derived from :func:`orchestrator.classify_degradation`'s four
disjoint groups and *not* from ``OperationState``:

=================================================  ====
condition                                          exit
=================================================  ====
any ``failed`` producer or apparatus failure       1
any ``blocking_drift``, no failures                2
only ``informational_drift`` / ``not_configured``  0
all fresh                                          0
=================================================  ====

A surviving ``not-configured`` can only come from an *optional* producer —
``registry._enforce_policy`` rewrites a *required* producer's ``not-configured``
to ``failed`` before it ever reaches here — so it is external degradation and by
decision must not block.

Two reconciliations are recorded rather than left implicit.

**Missing architecture provenance exits 2, not 1.** The exit table's "or
unverifiable architecture provenance" clause reads, in isolation, as though a
missing baseline were an apparatus failure. It is not: D4 maps missing,
malformed, and schema-invalid provenance to ``R.drift``, and the spec scenario
"Missing provenance blocks" requires *the drift exit code*. The ``architecture``
report block still names it ``unverifiable``, keeping "no baseline at all"
distinguishable from "digests disagree", but it is blocking drift. Exit ``1``
covers the case where the architecture producer could not reach a verdict at
all, which arrives as a ``failed`` result.

**The validator's exit ``2`` becomes the gate's exit ``1``.**
``validate_context_impact.py`` returns ``2`` for *usage* errors — a missing file
or an unloadable rule table — which collides with the drift convention where
``2`` means drift. Passing it through would report an apparatus failure as
actionable drift and send a reviewer looking for a stale artifact that does not
exist (D7).

The gate never constructs a semantic indexer and never probes Postgres or an
embedder, even when complete configuration is present in the environment. It
reports ``{"status": "not-attempted"}`` — deliberately not a
``SemanticIndexStatus`` member, because those describe *probe outcomes* and
``not-configured`` would assert that a probe found no configuration. Making no
currency claim is how "stale semantic results are never presented as current" is
satisfied by construction (D6).
