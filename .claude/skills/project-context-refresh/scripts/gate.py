"""Composed deterministic context drift gate (ri-10, design D1/D5/D6/D7).

One command that answers one question: *does this revision carry deterministic
context drift a reviewer must fix before merge?* It composes three arms that
exist already and adds the single thing none of them expresses — an exit code
derived from a classification rather than from a collapsed terminal state:

* **deterministic producers** — via :func:`orchestrator.check`, which runs every
  registered producer in ``check`` mode and writes neither the durable store nor
  the working tree. Dispatch is not re-implemented here;
* **architecture freshness** — via the orchestrator's architecture seam, whose
  default compares *local* provenance with ``check_freshness``. Consumed, not
  re-implemented, and reported without blocking (D2/D3);
* **work-package context impact** — ri-08's ``validate_context_impact``, invoked
  over the ``work-packages.yaml`` files present in the diff under test and
  **never** with ``--strict-legacy`` (D7).

Ownership boundary. This module owns *composition, classification wiring, and
rendering*. It owns no producer, no result model, and no schema. ``cli.py gate``
is a thin argument-parsing wrapper and ``make context-drift-gate`` is a thin
``make`` call, so a CI failure reproduces verbatim in a developer checkout —
which is the point of putting the rendering in Python instead of assembling it
from shell over job output (D1).

Exit codes (D5), derived from :func:`orchestrator.classify_degradation`'s four
disjoint groups and *not* from ``OperationState``:

=================================================  ====
condition                                          exit
=================================================  ====
any ``failed`` producer or apparatus failure       1
any ``blocking_drift``, no failures                2
only ``informational_drift`` / ``not_configured``  0
all fresh                                          0
=================================================  ====

A surviving ``not-configured`` can only come from an *optional* producer —
``registry._enforce_policy`` rewrites a *required* producer's ``not-configured``
to ``failed`` before it ever reaches here — so it is external degradation and by
decision must not block.

**Which blocking findings count depends on the triggering event (D4).** The table
above answers *how severe*; attribution answers *whose fault*; the event answers
*is this the run that must block on it*:

=========================  ===========  ==========  ===============
event                      introduced   inherited   indeterminate
=========================  ===========  ==========  ===============
``pull_request``           blocks       reported    reported
``merge_group``            blocks       blocks      blocks
``push`` (integration)     blocks       blocks      blocks
no event supplied          blocks       blocks      blocks
anything else              error — an unknown event is never a pass
=========================  ===========  ==========  ===============

Inherited drift is *reported*, not dropped: it stays in ``blocking_drift`` with
its attribution and owner, so exit ``0`` there reads as "someone else's debt".
The merge candidate is still asked, at ``merge_group`` and on the push that
follows, where there is no other branch to inherit from — so nothing reaches the
integration branch unchecked. Omitting the event selects the strict rule so that
every caller predating this change gets exactly the verdict it got before.

Two reconciliations are recorded rather than left implicit.

**Missing architecture provenance exits 0, and is still reported.** ri-10 D4
made unverifiable provenance *blocking*; that consequence is withdrawn here.
Architecture artifacts and their provenance are a regenerable local analysis
cache (D2), so their freshness is a property of the checkout that last
regenerated them and of no other. A gate run on any other checkout cannot
observe it, and blocking on it blocked on a condition true of every clean clone.
The architecture arm therefore joins ``openspec.projection`` in
``informational_drift`` and contributes nothing to the exit code (D3).

What survives from D4 is the *reporting* distinction, not the consequence: the
``architecture`` block still names a missing or malformed baseline
``unverifiable`` rather than ``not-configured``, so "no baseline at all" stays
distinguishable from "digests disagree" and from an absent optional owner. Exit
``1`` is untouched — the architecture producer that could not reach a verdict at
all still arrives as ``failed``, and one that drifted without naming an artifact
is still reclassified below. Only the *drift* verdict moved, and only in the
direction of exiting 0; nothing that exited 2 for a committed artifact does now.

Architecture findings reach ``informational_drift`` attributed ``indeterminate``:
:func:`_attribution_evidence` looks for provenance at the merge base, and after
D2 there is none to find. That is the correct reading of the vocabulary — the
evidence is absent, not the blame assigned — and it costs nothing, because
attribution only ever filters *blocking* findings for the exit code.

**The validator's exit ``2`` becomes the gate's exit ``1``.**
``validate_context_impact.py`` returns ``2`` for *usage* errors — a missing file
or an unloadable rule table — which collides with the drift convention where
``2`` means drift. Passing it through would report an apparatus failure as
actionable drift and send a reviewer looking for a stale artifact that does not
exist (D7).

The gate never constructs a semantic indexer and never probes Postgres or an
embedder, even when complete configuration is present in the environment. It
reports ``{"status": "not-attempted"}`` — deliberately not a
``SemanticIndexStatus`` member, because those describe *probe outcomes* and
``not-configured`` would assert that a probe found no configuration. Making no
currency claim is how "stale semantic results are never presented as current" is
satisfied by construction (D6).
