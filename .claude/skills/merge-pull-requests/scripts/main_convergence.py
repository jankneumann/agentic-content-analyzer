"""Main context convergence driver (ri-11).

``merge-pull-requests`` is the only skill that writes ``main``; every other skill
lands through a pull request from a managed worktree. That makes it the
authoritative main-synchronization point, and this module is the one place that
turns a completed merge pass into a converged main state: regenerated
deterministic context, one follow-up commit, one push, one enqueued semantic
index, and one tracked record of all of it.

Boundary (design D1). This is **not** a hook of ``post_merge_pipeline``. That
pipeline is deliberately per-PR and failure-isolated, so putting convergence
there would produce N convergences, N commits, and N index requests for N merged
PRs. Convergence fires **once per invocation pass** (Step 11.6), after the
per-PR loop has drained and after post-merge OpenSpec cleanup has staged its
output. ``k = 0`` merged PRs converge nothing at all: that pass was a read of
main, not a write.

Four invariants, in the order they matter:

1. **A refresh failure never un-merges and never blocks the merge** (D6).
   Convergence is strictly downstream of the merge commit. This module cannot
   revert, close, or reopen a pull request, and that is enforced at runtime by
   :func:`reverses_merge`, which every issued command passes through -- not by a
   comment claiming it is so.
2. **Idempotence is two-source** (D4). A retry detects a prior convergence from
   the terminal ri-06 operation record *or* from the ``Context-Refresh-Operation``
   commit trailer. Either alone is sufficient to skip; neither alone is
   sufficient as the only check, because the record is lost on a fresh clone and
   the trailer does not exist until the commit lands.
3. **Never fail open.** Unknown or unreachable state is degraded or blocked,
   never silent success. A run that could consult neither idempotence source
   reports ``inconclusive`` and refuses to converge, rather than assuming it is
   the first.
4. **Safe defaults.** Every seam defaults to the real thing, and every new
   behaviour is opt-in at the call site.

Self-reference, stated rather than hidden. A commit cannot contain its own SHA,
so the record that lands *inside* the convergence commit necessarily carries
``convergence_commit: null`` and the deferred (``pending``) semantic reference
that the refresh actually recorded. That in-flight shape is exactly what the
published schema anticipates. The *completed* record -- convergence commit SHA
plus the index enqueued for that final pushed revision -- is returned on
:class:`ConvergenceResult` for the pass summary and the merge log. Amending the
commit to close the loop was rejected: an amend after a partial failure silently
rewrites cleanup work that succeeded, and a second commit would make the pass
produce N+1 commits.
