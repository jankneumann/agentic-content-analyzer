"""Render the ``Semantic code context`` section for a coding job (ri-12, D7).

The single entry point, :func:`render_semantic_context`, takes one
``SemanticContextResult`` -- a mapping conforming to
``openspec/contracts/code-search/schemas/semantic-context-section.schema.json``
-- and returns the markdown block handed to a coding job. It reads nothing else:
no git, no network, no environment, no clock. That is what makes the output a
pure function of its input and the section reproducible from a stored result.

Three properties are load-bearing:

**Determinism.** Nothing here consults wall-clock time, ``random``, ``id()``,
process state, or set/dict iteration order. Hits and omissions render in the
order the retrieval helper supplied, which is its deterministic rank order (D5);
re-deriving that order here would create a second ordering authority that could
silently disagree with the machine-readable record.

**Fail-closed.** A section this module cannot interpret renders an explicit
"not injected" block, never an empty string and never a partial section. A
silent absence is indistinguishable from "no relevant code exists", and the
worker would never learn that it must fall back. The one exception is the
disabled flag: reason ``injection_disabled`` renders nothing at all, so a
flag-off run is byte-identical to the pre-ri-12 output (D9).

**Full attribution.** Every rendered hit shows its file, line range, score,
indexed commit, index id and scope decision. A hit missing any of them fails the
whole section closed rather than being rendered with a gap -- a section that
displays an excerpt it cannot attribute is making a claim it cannot support.

Render-name mapping (pinned by ``openspec/changes/<id>/contracts/README.md`` and
asserted by a wp-contracts test): the contract's ``score`` carries ri-03's
``CodeSearchHit.similarity`` and its ``indexed_commit`` carries
``source_revision``. This module renders those two under the roadmap's names --
``score=`` and ``indexed_commit=`` on the per-hit line, "indexed commit" in the
header prose -- and never under the coordinator's names.

Deviations from the D7 illustration, both deliberate:

* D7 abbreviates revisions and index ids (``1cf51386...``, ``9f1c...``). This
  module renders them in full. Provenance whose entire purpose is to be checkable
  should not be elided, and two indexes must never render identically.
* D7's fallback ``Reason`` bullet is prose only. This module prefixes the enum
  value, so the machine-readable cause is visible in the text a reviewer reads
  and the fallback tests can assert on something exact.

Standalone by design: stdlib only, no imports from ``semantic_context.py``, and
no ``__init__.py`` required in this directory.
