"""Scoped, deterministic semantic-context retrieval for coding jobs (ri-12).

This module turns one coordinator code-search response into the machine-readable
form of a ``Semantic code context`` section: a bounded, deduplicated, in-scope
list of hits with provenance, or an explicit fallback saying why nothing was
injected. It owns request construction, revision and namespace resolution, scope
derivation, the local deny re-check, deduplication, budgeting, and fallback
classification. It does not speak HTTP (``coordination-bridge`` does) and does
not render markdown (``render_semantic_context`` does).

Three properties are load-bearing and are what the tests in
``skills/tests/context-engineering/`` exist to hold:

**Determinism.** Ranking uses the five-tuple of design decision D5 and nothing
else — no clock, no RNG, no ``set``/``dict`` iteration over unordered input, no
object identity. The key is total within one response, so ``sorted()``'s
stability is never relied upon and the output cannot depend on the order the
service happened to return results in.

**Fail-closed.** Every path that cannot produce trustworthy context produces an
explicit :class:`ContextFallback`, never a silently empty success.
:func:`collect_semantic_context` never raises: raising would make an optional
context input able to block a coding job, which design decision D8 forbids.

**Scope safety.** The scope sent to the service is the *explicit* scope derived
from ri-08's ``index_scopes()`` (D2), and every returned hit is re-checked
against it locally. Widening a package's declared read scope is the exact
failure this change exists to prevent.

Opt-in: ``SEMANTIC_CONTEXT_INJECTION`` gates everything. When it is unset the
effective default comes from :data:`INJECTION_DEFAULT_ENABLED`, one named
declaration rather than a property inferred from the absence of an environment
variable (ri-13 D11), and it is ``False``. With injection off the helper
short-circuits before touching git, the bridge, or the network, so behaviour is
byte-identical to a tree without this module (D9). Flipping that constant is
authorized only by a passing evaluation report at
``docs/evaluation/semantic-context/report.json``; the Enablement Consistency
Gate (``make semantic-enablement-gate``) refuses a flip the evidence does not
support.
