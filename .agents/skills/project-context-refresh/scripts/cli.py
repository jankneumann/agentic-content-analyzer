"""CLI for the deterministic context producers (ri-05) and the refresh
orchestrator (ri-07).

Per-producer subcommands (ri-05) keep each producer independently runnable:

    python scripts/cli.py list
    python scripts/cli.py check <producer_id>
    python scripts/cli.py generate <producer_id>
    python scripts/cli.py check-all

Orchestration subcommands (ri-07) drive every configured producer into one
durable operation and emit the manifest:

    python scripts/cli.py refresh                       # generate + manifest
    python scripts/cli.py refresh --producer api.contracts   # one producer
    python scripts/cli.py refresh-check                 # read-only drift

``refresh`` carries two opt-in flags for the main-convergence sync point (ri-11),
both defaulting to off so that every existing invocation behaves exactly as before:

* ``--sync-point`` authorizes the mutation from the shared checkout by reaching
  the checkout policy's ``approved_sync_point`` branch. It is a *caller* decision
  and is never inferred from the environment — an environment sniff would re-open
  shared-checkout writes for every skill that happens to run on ``main``. The
  caller remains responsible for its own clean-tree and active-agent guards.
* ``--defer-semantic-index`` skips the inline index attempt and records the index
  as ``pending`` with an ``exact-search`` fallback, for a caller that enqueues the
  index itself against a later revision. Pending is a weaker claim than attempted,
  so a deferred run degrades (exit 2) rather than reporting success.

The branch-local checkpoint (ri-09) is a *third* mode, deliberately outside the
operation ledger: read-only, scoped to one work package, and advisory.

    python scripts/cli.py checkpoint --change-id C --package-id P \
        --changed-file docs/guide.md

The composed drift gate (ri-10) is a *fourth* mode: read-only, repository-wide,
and blocking. It is what ``make context-drift-gate`` runs, so a CI failure
reproduces verbatim in a developer checkout.

    python scripts/cli.py gate --base main
    python scripts/cli.py gate --base main --event pull_request

The exit code distinguishes deterministic drift from an internal failure:

* ``0`` — fresh / succeeded (or a generate that wrote successfully);
* ``2`` — drift / degraded detected (actionable, not an error);
* ``1`` — a producer failed or a fail-closed input error.

``checkpoint`` deliberately does not use ``2``: drift is data in its report, and
its only non-zero exit is being unable to produce a valid report at all (D8).

``gate`` uses the same three codes but derives them from ri-10's classification
rather than from ``OperationState``, which is why the two can disagree on the
same tree: an absent *optional* owner degrades ``refresh-check`` to ``2`` and
leaves ``gate`` at ``0``, because a required producer reporting no configuration
has already been rewritten to a failure by registry policy, so a surviving one
is external degradation. ``_exit_code`` and ``refresh-check`` keep their
mappings unchanged; the gate is a third caller with its own documented codes.

``--event`` narrows *which* blocking findings the code is derived from, never
which are reported: on ``pull_request`` drift the branch inherited from the
integration branch is listed with its owner and does not fail the gate, while on
``merge_group`` and ``push`` every blocking finding does. Omitting it selects the
strict rule, so a local run and the pre-existing callers keep today's verdict.
An event the gate has no rule for exits ``1`` — an apparatus failure, because the
gate cannot say which rule applies — and deliberately not argparse's own ``2``,
which here would read as drift.

Output is the canonical ri-06 ``ProducerResult`` JSON (a list for ``*-all``) or,
for the orchestrator, a refresh summary, so callers parse exactly what ri-07
persists.
