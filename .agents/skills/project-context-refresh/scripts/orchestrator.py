"""Cross-producer refresh orchestration (ri-07).

One idempotent operation that drives every configured context producer for an
exact repository revision, stages their canonical results on the single ri-06
operation, and emits the durable manifest — without re-implementing any producer,
result, or manifest model.

Ownership boundary (design D1):

* Producers, results, generate/check protocol → ri-05 ``registry`` + the
  ``architecture`` producer (ri-04).
* Durable operation store, manifest projection, and every data model → ri-06
  ``project-context-runtime``.
* This module owns only *coordination*: order, recording, outcome, and manifest
  emission.

Two modes:

* :func:`generate` — reuse/create the canonical operation, run every configured
  producer, record each result **before** attempting the degradable semantic
  index, finalize the terminal outcome, then write + record the manifest.
* :func:`check` — fully read-only: run every producer in ``check`` mode, decide
  the aggregate outcome, and return it with an exit code (0 fresh · 2 drift · 1
  failed). It never writes the store or the working tree.

The semantic index (ri-02) is the one degradable producer: its failure or absence
degrades the outcome but never discards deterministic output, because deterministic
and architecture results are recorded first (design D3/D4).
